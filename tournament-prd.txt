Tournament feature proposal
Core concepts
1. Persistent teams
Teams exist independently (not just per match)
Players can be assigned to teams with jersey numbers
Teams can participate in multiple tournaments

2. Tournament types
Round Robin: All teams play each other (best for 4-8 teams)
Knockout: Single elimination bracket (best for 4, 8, 16 teams)
Hybrid: Group stage + knockout (best for 8+ teams)
Double Elimination: Fairer, more matches

3. Tournament structure
Registration phase: Teams register
Fixture generation: Auto-generate matches based on type
Standings: Auto-update after each match
Prize distribution: Automatic calculation + manual override

4. Statistics & prizes
Team standings (points, wins, goals)
Player leaderboards (goals, assists, ratings)
Prize categories:
Team prizes: 1st, 2nd, 3rd place
Individual: Top scorer, most assists, best defender, MVP
